# after meeting with Bill on 10042023, I need to further down the analysis

# for cost, maybe try to add the work hours \* work rate

# for each category, what is the average and what is the variance, if we want to set a flat rate based on the historical experience

# would it be correct? and how so

# seperate the work hours by partner/interns...... how many hours of each shall be considered
