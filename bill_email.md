Good afternoon Bill

Ben and I have generated the interactive eviction analysis report using the provided data regarding time trend and geographical information. Please review and share your thoughts:

- Are the results as expected?
- Any need for further analysis?
- Feedback on report usability?
- Other stakeholders for report sharing?

Any feedback is much appreciated.

Best regards,
Charles Zhang
