1. cost analysis
   search for the direct cost(is there any cost except the rate) and indirect cost(maybe all the costs info) for the 2 matters at least

2. market search
   not likely, since these data are secret info to other law firms as well

3. specific value and industry standard
   anything only phelps can provide, cannot think of any

4. client demographic
   only have the geographical info right now, maybe more?

5. time invested
   have graphs describing already

6. legal requirement
   no idea how we are doing this

7. flexibilty
   have graphs talking about this, maybe more info
